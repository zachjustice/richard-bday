Now that you know what you know, is there anything you'd do differently?

Review the work done in this conversation so far. Consider:
- Decisions made and their trade-offs
- Approaches taken vs alternatives
- Anything you'd change with hindsight
- Potential improvements or risks spotted after the fact

Be honest and specific. Reference actual files and code when relevant.
