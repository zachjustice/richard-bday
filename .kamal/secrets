# Secrets defined here are available for reference under registry/password, env/secret, builder/secrets,
# and accessories/*/env/secret in config/deploy.yml. All secrets should be pulled from either
# password manager, ENV, or a file. DO NOT ENTER RAW CREDENTIALS HERE! This file needs to be safe for git.

# Example of extracting secrets from 1password (or another compatible pw manager)
# SECRETS=$(kamal secrets fetch --adapter 1password --account your-account --from Vault/Item KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD RAILS_MASTER_KEY)
# KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$(kamal secrets extract KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD ${SECRETS})
# RAILS_MASTER_KEY=$(kamal secrets extract RAILS_MASTER_KEY ${SECRETS})

# GitHub Container Registry token with packages:write permission
# Use a GITHUB_TOKEN if private repositories are needed for the image
# GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh config get -h github.com oauth_token) # Using $GITHUB_TOKEN from my bashrc since I need permissions to push to the github image repo and the oauth_token didn't have permissions for some reason

# Grab the registry password from ENV
KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=$GITHUB_TOKEN

# Improve security by using a password manager. Never check config/master.key into git!
# Rails master key for decrypting credentials
