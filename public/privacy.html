      <p class="body-text"><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it
          is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with
          your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
          obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>

      <p class="body-text"><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em>
      </p>

      <p class="body-text">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid
        legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following
        legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to
          use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
          about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is
          necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request
          prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
          necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
          fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the
          purposes described in order to:
          <ul>
            <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve gameplay and service quality</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for
          compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
          exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
          involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to
          protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
          threats to the safety of any person.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="body-text"><em><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>

      <p class="body-text">We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express
        consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
        inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</p>

      <p class="body-text">In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
        information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
        </li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an
          insurance claim</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
        </li>

      <p class="body-text"><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We offer features powered in-part by
          artificial intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies.</em></p>

      <p class="body-text">As part of our Services, we offer features powered by artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, or similar technologies (collectively, "AI Products"). These tools are designed
        to enhance your experience and provide you with innovative solutions. The terms in this Privacy Notice govern
        your use of the AI Products within our Services.</p>

      <p class="body-text"><strong>Use of AI Technologies</strong></p>

      <p class="body-text">We provide the AI Products through third-party service providers ("AI Service Providers"),
        including Anthropic. As outlined in this Privacy Notice, your input and output will be
        shared with and processed by these AI Service Providers to enable your use of our AI Products for purposes
        outlined in "<a href="#legalbases">What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Personal Information?</a>" You
        must not use the AI Products in any way that violates the terms or policies of any AI Service Provider.</p>

      <p class="body-text"><strong>Our AI Products</strong></p>

      <p class="body-text">Our AI Products are designed for the following functions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Answer smoothing</strong> — AI processes user-submitted game answers to improve grammatical flow
          within stories. For example, adjusting verb tense or article usage so that a player's answer reads naturally
          in the context of the story.</li>
      </ul>

        throughout the process, giving you peace of mind about your data's safety.</p>

      <p class="body-text"><strong>How to Opt Out</strong></p>

      <p class="body-text">To opt out of AI processing, you can contact us at <a
          href="mailto:support@blanksies.net">support@blanksies.net</a> to request that your game contributions not be
        processed by AI features. Game creators can also disable AI answer smoothing in their room settings.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading" id="inforetain">7. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

      <p class="body-text"><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>

      <p class="body-text">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
        set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
        information for longer than the period of time in which you actively use our Services or maintain an Editor account with us.</p>

      <p class="body-text">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
        will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading" id="infosafe">8. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

      <p class="body-text"><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a
          system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>

      <p class="body-text">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures
        designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
        steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
        transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
        Services within a secure environment.</p>

      <p class="body-text">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its

        in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

      <p class="body-text"><strong><u>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</u></strong> You can

      <p class="body-text">Upon your request to terminate your Editor account, we will deactivate or delete your account and

      <h2 class="section-heading" id="DNT">10. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>

      <p class="body-text">Most web browsers include a
        Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

      <p class="body-text">California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because
        there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond
        to them at this time.</p>

      <p class="body-text"><strong><u>Global Privacy Control:</u></strong> We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control
        (GPC) signals as a matter of policy. However, we do not currently engage in targeted advertising, sell personal
        information, or share it for advertising purposes, so there is currently no sale or sharing to opt out of via
        GPC. If our practices change in the future, GPC signals will be automatically honored as a valid opt-out request
        under applicable state privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), without requiring you
